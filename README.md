Data Analytics on the Wine Dataset

The wine industry is a fast-growing one, and has shown exponential growth over the past few decades. With this consumption growth comes the need to deliver the best quality wine. Understanding how the variation in one of the factors associated with the wine affects the overall quality of the wine is the primary objective of this study. We try to do Exploratory Data Analysis along with visualizations, and literature review.
